# Shellcaster

Shellcaster is a terminal-based podcast manager, built in Rust. It provides a terminal UI (i.e., ncurses) to allow users to subscribe to podcast feeds, and sync feeds to check for new episodes. Episodes may be downloaded locally, played (with an external media player, at least for now), and marked as played/unplayed. Keybindings and other options are configurable via a config file.

Note that shellcaster is not yet in stable format, and is still in active development. However, the basic functionality is present, and it should generally be usable (with some bugs and irritations still to be worked out!).

## Installing shellcaster

There are currently a couple of ways to install shellcaster. The following assumes you already have Rust + cargo installed.

1. You can install the latest version of the binary directly from crates.io with one command:

```bash
cargo install shellcaster
```

2. You can clone the Github repo and compile it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeff-hughes/shellcaster.git
cd shellcaster
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/shellcaster /usr/local/bin/
shellcaster  # to run
```

If you want to change configuration settings:

```bash
# on Linux
mkdir -p ~/.config/shellcaster
cp config.toml ~/.config/shellcaster/

# on MacOS
mkdir -p ~/Library/Preferences/shellcaster
cp config.toml ~/Library/Preferences/shellcaster/
```

(If you installed directly with cargo, the sample `config.toml` file can be copied from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-hughes/shellcaster/master/config.toml). Place it in the same location as noted above.)

Or you can put `config.toml` in a place of your choosing, and specify the location at runtime:

```bash
shellcaster -c /path/to/config.toml
```

## Platform support

Shellcaster has currently only been tested extensively on Linux x86_64. Earlier versions were tested on MacOS, but not extensively. Unix systems in general, on x86_64 (64-bit), i686 (32-bit), and ARM, are the primary targets for support for the app.

Shellcaster is not currently supported on Windows, although some work has been done to try to get it working. Unicode support is weak, however, and there are issues when resizing the screen. You may have better luck using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2), but this has not been tested. If you are a Windows user and want to help work out the bugs, pull requests are more than welcome!

## Default keybindings

| Key     | Action         |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Arrow keys / h,j,k,l | Navigate menus |
| a       | Add new feed |
| q       | Quit program |
| s       | Synchronize selected feed |
| Shift+S | Synchronize all feeds |
| Enter / p | Play selected episode |
| m       | Mark selected episode as played/unplayed |
| Shift+M | Mark all episodes as played/unplayed |
| d       | Download selected episode |
| Shift+D | Download all episodes |
| x       | Delete downloaded file |
| Shift+X | Delete all downloaded files |
| r       | Remove selected feed/episode from list |
| Shift+R | Remove all feeds/episodes from list |

Keybindings can be modified in the config.toml file. Actions can be
mapped to more than one key, but a single key may not do more than one
action.

## Contributing

Contributions from others are welcome! If you wish to contribute, feel free to clone the repo and submit pull requests. **Please ensure you are on the `develop` branch when making your edits**, as this is where the continued development of the app is taking place. Pull requests will only be merged to the `develop` branch, so you can help to avoid merge conflicts by doing your work on that branch in the first place.

## Why "shellcaster"?

I was trying to come up with a play on the word "podcast", and I liked the use of the word "shell" for several reasons. "Shell" is a synonym for the word "pod". The terminal is also referred to as a shell (and shellcaster is a terminal-based program). In addition, the program is built on Rust, whose mascot is Ferris the crab. Finally, I just personally enjoy that "shellcaster" sounds a lot like "spellcaster", so you can feel like a wizard when you use the program...

I'm simulating a new release! Hooray!
