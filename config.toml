# Shellcaster settings
# --------------------

# Specifies where podcast episodes that are downloaded will be stored.
# Defaults:
# $XDG_DATA_HOME/shellcaster/ or $HOME/.local/share/shellcaster/ on Linux
# $HOME/Library/Application Support/shellcaster/ on Mac
# C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\shellcaster\ on Windows

#download_path = "~/.local/share/shellcaster/"


# Maximum number of files to download simultaneously. Setting this too
# high could result in network requests being denied. A good general
# guide would be to set this to the number of processor cores on your
# computer.
# Default: 3

#simultaneous_downloads = 3;


# Command to use to play episodes. Use "%s" to indicate where file/URL
# will be entered to the command.
# Default: vlc %s

play_command = "vlc %s"


[keybindings]

# Keybindings must be an array of one or more strings.
# If you want to distinguish between a regular alphanumeric key
# and Shift+key, you can use the capital letter that you would normally
# type when pressing Shift+key (e.g., Shift+"r" will give you "R").

# Other special characters and their config string:
# Arrow keys: "Left", "Right", "Up", "Down"
# Ctrl+key: "C-key" (e.g., "C-r" means Ctrl+"r")
# Shift+key: "S-key" (e.g., "S-Del" means Shift+Delete)
# Insert ("Ins"), Delete ("Del"), Home ("Home"), End ("End"),
# Page up ("PgUp"), Page down ("PgDn"), Tab ("Tab")
# Enter ("Enter"), Escape ("Esc") -- be aware that on some terminals the
# Escape key waits for further input before passing it along to
# shellcaster, so you might notice a delay with this key

# Don't try to use backslash, or you're gonna have a bad time
